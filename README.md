# Human Computer Interaction (hci)
All assignments and exercises for the class **Human Computer Interaction** of year 2023/2024.

The assignments span both user interface development and signal processing for human-computer interaction, focusing on practical, real-world tasks and robust technical implementations.

## What’s Inside
- **Assignment 1**:

  Removal of Eye Artifacts from EEG Signals Using ICA (MATLAB)
  Implementation of the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm to identify and remove ocular artifacts from EEG signals. Includes data visualization, code, and a detailed report.

- **Assignment 2**:

  Order Management Desktop Application for Pizzeria Picko (Electron, React, Tailwind)
  Design and implementation of a user-centered GUI desktop application for order entry, following usability heuristics (Nielsen’s principles). Includes user analysis, interface design rationale, and code.

- **Assignment 3**:

  MATLAB GUI for Arbitrary EEG Filtering with FIR Filters
  Development of an interactive MATLAB interface for flexible filtering and visualization of EEG signals using customizable FIR spectral filters. Supports multiple filter types and signal export.

Each assignment folder includes further documentation, code, and reports. To view final assignment results, please read each report.
